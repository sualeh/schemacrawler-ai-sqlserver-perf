# SchemaCrawler AI MCP Server for SQL Server Performance

This is a Python MCP Server using Fast MCP. Each MCP tool will make a connection to a database, execute SQL and return the results as JSON. The SQL is hardcoded but is a template - parts of the SQL including table names may be replaced based on tool parameters.
